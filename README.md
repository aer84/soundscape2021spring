Title: A Day at the Movies

Welcome to a time before a global pandemic. A time where we could go to the movies and our biggest concerns were the cost of popcorn and being on time for the movie. This soundscape is meant to remind people of the atmosphere of movie theaters from the sounds of popping of popcorn, new movies, and people anxiously waiting for the movie to start. Grab some popcorn yourself and listen  along as two friends walk through the theater to see "Hidden Figures" on the big screen.
