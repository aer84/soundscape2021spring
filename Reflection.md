This project definitely felt intimidating when I first started it. As a digital media student, most of my work has focused on visuals, so working with sound required a lot of time and dedication. I believe my project meets all of the baseline criteria and even meets several of the aspiration inspirations.

Greg's Feedback

I believe that I really tested myself to not only meet the criteria but to challenge myself. I recorded multiple sounds within the narration of three different characters as well as had multiple sounds overlapping. I also spent a lot of time developing an intentional ending with the start of the movie. I really liked this ending because it felt interesting ending the soundscape with the beginning sequence of a movie. I was hoping that by the end would make listeners feel like turning on a movie thus extending the soundscape. This idea was actually inspired by Greg who suggested compressing a movie during the workshop (as seen in the screenshot). I also think when the two characters are walking to their theater that there is a change in tone. The intense music of the spy and science fiction greatly juxtaposes the otherwise silent walk.

Progress

Progress 2:11

In terms of aspirational inspirations, I used several different background tracks to create a consistent narrative as other sounds to create a 3D environment. In this soundscape over 18 sounds were employed to create this environment. One thing that I was very happy with during the workshop is that everyone was able to figure out that they were in a movie theater and I believe with the narration that listeners will be fully aware of what is happening. As I have never worked with Audacity, I would say that I have been able to develop a deeper understanding of the software. I also worked to maintain an organized file for this assignment with meaningful commit messages (seen in the first progress picture and a more recent screenshot)

Final Soundscape

When I look back on this project (final screenshot of progress above), I am very proud of the work I created. At first, I felt like I just had an idea but not a lot of direction. I think the feedback from my classmates and professor was the main reason I finally started to see what this soundscape could be. I really hated it for a while since it felt messy and all over the place. I think that the narration gave the soundscape an important anchor that made it much easier to understand. I thought that the hardest part of this assignment would be finding the perfect sound for free, yet this didn’t end up being the hardest part of the assignment. Although understanding the software and the best way to edit the audio presented several challenges, the hardest challenge in this project was my headphones (seen in screenshot below). For some reason, my headphones would not connect to Audacity and it was difficult to hear what my final project would sound like with headphones. Although this challenge was never resolved, I think that I was still able to create an immersive experience with my soundscape. Another challenge that I overcame was the length of the soundscape. With the parameters being between 2-5 minutes, I often felt nervous that I would either not be able to create a soundscape long enough or that it would be too long. The length that the soundscape ended up being felt appropriate, so it wasn’t too fast (thus overwhelming listeners) or too short (making listeners want more).

Problem on 2:11

My original goal was to make it feel like you were walking through a movie theater and I would definitely say that I accomplished this goal based on the feedback. Overall, I am really proud of this project and for transforming the different sounds and recordings into a soundscape.
